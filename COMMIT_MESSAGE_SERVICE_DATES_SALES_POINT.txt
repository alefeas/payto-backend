feat: add service dates to AFIP and auto-inherit sales point for NC/ND

Service Dates Implementation:
- Send FchServDesde, FchServHasta to AFIP for concept 2 (services) and 3 (products+services)
- Send FchVtoPago (payment due date) for services (required by AFIP)
- Fallback to issue date if service dates are missing
- Add concept, service_date_from, service_date_to to compatible invoices response

Sales Point Auto-Inheritance:
- Add sales_point to compatible invoices response
- NC/ND automatically inherit sales point from associated invoice
- Ensures AFIP compliance (NC/ND must use same sales point as original invoice)

AFIP Compliance:
- Service dates required for concept 2 (services) and 3 (products+services)
- NC/ND must use same sales point as original invoice
- Payment due date required for services
