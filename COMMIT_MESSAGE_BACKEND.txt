- Replace individual queries per connection with aggregated queries
- Reduce database queries from N×5 to 3 total queries (94% improvement)
- Add eager loading for connectedCompany relation in pendingRequests() and sentRequests()
- Improve query performance for invoice statistics (sent/received counts and amounts)
- Replace ROW_NUMBER window function with collection-based approach for better MySQL compatibility
- Fix intermittent "Error loading data" issues caused by query timeouts

Performance impact:
- 10 connections: 50+ queries → 3 queries
